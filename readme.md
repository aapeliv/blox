A small game where you form rows out of dropping blocks.

Blox is written in C++11 and uses the excellent [SFML 2.0](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) library for graphics.

The code isn't particularly well commented, but it's fairly straightforward and should be easy to follow. Also I'm not sure if memory management is properly implemented.
