===

A small game where you form rows out of dropping blocks. Hosted [here](http://www.aapelivuorinen.com/blox).

The code isn't particularly well commented, but it's fairly straightforward and should be easy to follow. Also I'm not sure if memory management is properly impelemnted.

The program uses the fonts [Inconsolata](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata) (SIL Open Font License 1.1) and [Chewy](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Chewy) (Apache License 2.0).
